# Motion Detection using OpenCV
### This project aims to detect motion in a video stream using OpenCV library. The code reads frames from the default camera (webcam) and applies various image processing techniques to identify any movement in the scene.

### The program displays the original frame along with the threshold and Gaussian blur frames to visualize the motion detection process. Detected motion is indicated with a green rectangle around the moving object(s).

### The timestamps of the start and end of each motion event are recorded and stored in a CSV file "Times.csv".

## Dependencies:
- OpenCV
- Pandas
## Usage:
- Run the code using any Python IDE or from the command line
- Press "q" to quit the program
